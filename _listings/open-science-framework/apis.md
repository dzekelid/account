description: OSF provides free and open source project management support for researchers
  across the entire research lifecycle. As a collaboration tool, OSF helps researchers
  work on projects privately with a limited number of collaborators and make parts
  of their projects public, or make all the project publicly accessible for broader
  dissemination. As a workflow system, OSF enables connections to the many services
  researchers already use to streamline their process and increase efficiency. As
  a flexible repository, it can store and archive research data, protocols, and materials.
